# Example #: [ 01 ]

## Imperative Approach [2 Minutes]

1. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
   
   - In the imperative approach, the code provides explicit instructions for each action.
   - The code starts by preheating the grill to a specific temperature (204Â°C).
   - It then seasons the steak with 'Salt and Pepper' on both sides.
   - The cooking process involves grilling the steak and continuously measuring its internal temperature.
   - The code adjusts the grill temperature and cooking time based on the steak's weight and the desired doneness temperature.
   - The steak's temperature is updated incrementally by 5 units in each iteration.

3. **Emphasis on How:**
   - The imperative approach focuses on detailing "how" the task is accomplished step by step.
   - It uses a while loop to iterate through the cooking process until the steak reaches the desired doneness temperature.
   - The code includes conditional statements to check if the steak is done and break out of the loop 
    accordingly.
   - Mutable variables like `grillTemperature` and `steakTemperature` track the state and progress of 
   the cooking process.

By following these steps and emphasizing the detailed instructions and state changes, the imperative approach ensures a clear and structured way of cooking the steak to perfection.

## Declarative Approach [2 Minutes]

1. **High-Level Process Description:**
   - The code follows a declarative approach to outline the cooking process for a steak.
   - It focuses on defining the cooking steps abstractly without delving into implementation details.
   - The cooking process is described as a series of actions to be taken, such as preheating the grill, seasoning the steak, cooking to desired doneness, and serving.

2. **Use of Data Structures:**
   - The cooking process is represented using an array of objects, with each object containing an action 
     and relevant data.
   - This structured format allows for a clear organization of the cooking steps and separates the 
     actions from the specific values.
   - The use of objects helps encapsulate each step with its associated information, promoting a more 
     organized and readable code structure.

# Learning Outcome [1 Minute]

- Analyzing this code example in a declarative approach highlights the importance of abstraction and 
  high-level planning in programming.
- Understanding the distinction between defining the "what" (declarative) versus the "how" (imperative) 
  in coding can lead to more modular and maintainable code.
- By utilizing data structures effectively to represent processes, developers can create scalable and 
  adaptable solutions for various scenarios.
